    <h1 class="branch-name">The Judicial Branch</h1>
    <img src="./assets/scotus2.jfif">
    <p>The federal judicial court system is made up of the District Courts, Circuit Courts, and the Supreme Court.</p>
    <p>There are 12 geographical boundaries, in addition to a federal court, in the United States that make up the District and Circuit Court systems.</p>
    <p>The District Court system involves trial cases, both criminal and civil, that involve federal law or multiple state disputes. At least one court is located in each state within a geographical boundary. District Court judges are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.</p>
    <p>The Circuit Court system involves appeal cases. Once a decision has been made by a District Court, an appeal can be made to the Circuit Court, which if they accept, will then rehear the case. The Circuit Court can decide to uphold the District Court ruling, or they can overrule the ruling and make a new one. Each Circuit Court has numerous judges. All judges are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.</p>
    <p>The Supreme Court is the highest court in the United States. They deal with appeals to decisions made by Circuit Courts or State Supreme Courts. If they accept an appeal, they will rehear the case and either choose to uphold the ruling or provide a new ruling. Whichever decision the Supreme Court makes will apply to every state in the country. For example, if the Supreme Court hears a case about free speech restrictions in New Jersey public schools and they rule that free speech cannot be restricted in said schools, then free speech cannot be restricted in every public school in the country. There are currently 9 justices on the Court. The Chief Justice oversees the Court. All justices are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.</p>
    <p>Every judge in the US Federal Court System serves life terms.</p>
