    <h1 class="branch-name">The Legislative Branch</h1>
    <img src="./assets/capitol.jfif">
    <p>The Legislative branch of Congress is the lawmaking body of the federal government. It consists of two chambers, the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Senate has 100 members, 2 from each state. The House has 435 members, given proportionally to each state based on population.</p>
    <h1>Senate</h1>
    <p>Senators are elected by the whole state and represent everyone in the state. The term length for a Senator is 6 years. There are no term limits. To be in the Senate, you have to be 30+ years old, a 9+ year citizen, and a resident of the state you're representing. ⅓ of Senate members are up for election every 2 years.</p>
    <p>The Senate has leadership positions for each party that is in the majority and minority. The Senate Majority Leader determines which bills are put up for a vote, presides over the chamber as a whole, and determines who gets put on each committee. The Senate Majority Whip counts the votes among the majority party and gets everyone in the party on the same side for a vote. The Senate Minority Leader directs debate among the minority party members and is the spokesperson for their party. The Senate Minority Whip has the same job as the Majority Whip but for the minority party.</p>
    <p>The Senate has specific rules that it follows for debate that are different than in the House. First, debate in the Senate has no limits, it can go on for however long the Senators wish. Any amendment added onto a bill does not have to relate to the bill topic. The Senate also has the tool called the filibuster. The filibuster is when a Senator speaks for an extremely long time on any topic to prevent the ending of debate and to kill a bill. The Senate may overcome the filibuster with a cloture vote to end debate which requires 60 Senators to vote yes.</p>
    <p>The Senate can consider certain bills that cannot be filibustered and have pre determined limits on debate. Debate on a budget resolution can last no more than 50 hours. The Senate also has a certain type of process for passing a bill called budget reconciliation. With budget reconciliation, the annual budget resolution creates instructions for committees to create bills later on to deal with certain aspects of the budget. Budget reconciliation bills only need a simple majority to end debate, preventing the use of the filibuster. However, budget reconciliation bills are usually limited to 1-2 per year by the Senate Parliamentarian, the main rules interpreter of the chamber.</p>
    <p>The Senate uses voice voting (everyone is asked to say yes or no collectively) and roll call voting (each member is called individually to vote).</p>
    <h1>House</h1>
    <p>House Representatives are elected to represent a certain area of their state called a district. The term length for a Representative is 2 years. There are no term limits. To be in the House, you have to be 25+ years old, a 7+ year citizen, and a resident of the represented district. Every member of the House is up for election every 2 years.</p>
    <p>The House has leadership positions for each party that is in the majority and minority. The Speaker of the House presides over the House floor, recognizes speakers, determines who from their party is on what committee, and decides which bills are heard. They are elected by the House as a whole and each party puts up a nominee. The House Majority Leader directs debate among the majority party members and is the spokesperson for their party. The House Majority Whip counts the votes among the majority party and gets everyone in the party on the same side for a vote. The House Minority Leader directs debate among the minority party members and is the spokesperson for their party. The House Minority Whip has the same job as the Majority Whip but for the minority party.</p>
    <p>Debate in the House is limited and the limit changes for each bill. The House Rules Committee determines the rules of debate for each bill that goes to the main floor of the chamber. Amendments to bills have to be germane or related to the bill topic.</p>
    <p>The House uses electronic voting (each member votes yes, no, or abstains via a machine), voice voting (everyone is asked to say yes or no collectively), and roll call voting (each member is called individually to vote).</p>
    <p>US House districts have to be redrawn every 10 years, after the Census.</p>
    <h1>Overall</h1>
    <p>Each chamber is broken up into different committees. A committee is a small group of members to discuss bills relating to a specific topic. Some committees are permanent and some are temporary.</p>
    <h1>Passing a Bill</h1>
    <p>In order for a bill to to pass in Congress, it must make it through several steps involving debates, votes, and revisions.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>A bill is introduced in Congress</li>
        <li>The Majority Leader in the Senate or Speaker of the House sends the bill to an appropriate committee</li>
        <li>The bill is discussed and amended in committee</li>
        <li>The committee then votes of whether to pass the bill</li>
        <li>The bill is then sent to the main chamber where it is discussed and amended further</li>
        <li>The whole chamber then votes on the bill</li>
        <li>A joint committee is formed if each chamber passed a different version of the bill to make both bills similar</li>
        <li>The final bill is then sent to the President to either sign into law or veto</li>
        <li>Congress can overturn a veto and make the bill law with a ⅔ majority in both chambers</li>
    </ol>
